### About this repository

This repository contains the comprehensive dataset for the
[MeLiDos](www.melidos.eu) field study site of Dortmund, Germany. Data
were collected by [Federal Institute for Occupational Safety and Health
(BAuA)](https://www.baua.de) and are further processed and analysed by
the [Translational Sensory & Circadian Neuroscience Unit
(TSCN)](https://www.tscnlab.org). A detailed description of the
experiment is available in [Guidolin et al.,
2024](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/39592960).

This repository is transitioning towards a
[FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) and fully human and
machine-readable light exposure dataset, based on a [community-based and
peer-reviewed Metadata
descriptor](https://bmcdigitalhealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s44247-024-00113-9).
As part of this transition, files will be converted from
semi-rectangular data, to fully [tabular
data](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/tabular-data-package/). Further,
metadata will be added and converted from XLSX to JSON. For full
traceability, all versions will be archived in
[Zenodo](https://zenodo.org) and are accessible through their own
persistent identifier (DOI).
